# AristAI Design System Master

## Direction
- Product type: educational SaaS, institution-facing.
- Visual style: editorial, restrained, confident.
- UX goal: reduce generic AI SaaS feel; prioritize clarity and workflow.

## IA Rules
- Public entry goes to product introduction, not login.
- Authentication is a continuation step from `Request a demo`.
- In-app navigation keeps task order visible and stable.

## Typography
- Primary family: Plus Jakarta Sans.
- Heading tone: concise, specific, low marketing noise.
- Body copy: operational and instructional, not hype-driven.

## Color + Surfaces
- Keep neutral backgrounds dominant.
- Use yellow accent for CTA/focus only.
- Avoid frequent gradient blocks and decorative color bands.

## Components
- Buttons: medium contrast, minimal elevation, clear primary/secondary hierarchy.
- Cards: subtle border + soft shadow, no exaggerated lift.
- Tabs: understated active state, high readability.

## Motion
- Keep motion minimal (150-250ms).
- Use opacity/position transitions only when meaningful.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Accessibility
- Maintain visible focus ring on interactive elements.
- Keep text contrast at or above WCAG AA.
- Ensure mobile tap targets stay >= 44px where relevant.

## Page Priorities
1. Public introduction and request-demo gateway.
2. Shell and shared primitives.
3. Dashboard and courses high-frequency flows.
4. Remaining pages and consistency QA.
