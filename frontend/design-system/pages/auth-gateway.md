# Page Override: auth-gateway

## Purpose
Authenticate users as part of a guided demo/access flow.

## Copy Rules
- Title should reflect demo access continuation.
- Explain that access is provisioned by institution/team onboarding.
- Keep error states direct and local to fields/actions.

## UI Rules
- Preserve social sign-in options if configured.
- Remove self-serve growth copy that conflicts with demo-gated flow.
- Keep form contrast and keyboard focus states clear.
