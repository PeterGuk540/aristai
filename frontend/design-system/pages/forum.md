# Page Override: forum

## Purpose
Center classroom discussion content and moderation controls.

## UI Rules
- Author metadata and post content should read as primary information.
- Pinned posts may use subtle warm highlighting, not loud branding accents.
- Reply threads should remain scannable with minimal chrome.

## Interaction Rules
- Moderation actions must stay visible but low-distraction.
- Composer and reply flows should keep immediate feedback and clear affordance.
