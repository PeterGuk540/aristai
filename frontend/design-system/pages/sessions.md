# Page Override: sessions

## Purpose
Make session planning and status transitions operationally clear.

## UI Rules
- Session list and detail pane should remain visually balanced.
- Status controls use semantic color only for status itself, not decoration.
- Maintain readable hierarchy for plan sections (topics, goals, prompts).

## Interaction Rules
- Keep lifecycle actions context-aware and mutually clear.
- Avoid ambiguous visual emphasis on non-primary actions.
